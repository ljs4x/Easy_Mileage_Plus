Task was to create a web application of our own which would CREATE/READ/UPDATE/DELETE information on a database.  Class was centered on PHP and MySQL, so we went with that as our base technology.  

Application was created and tested on the cloud9 virtual workspace.  This enabled easy collaboration and problem solving, as well as immediate testing of any changes. 

Database design and implementation was handled by Lucas Schwarz.  Frontend was created by Travis Karpinski.  Backend PHP was written by Khang Quach and Lucas Schwarz. All team members collaborated in all aspects of design in one form or another.
